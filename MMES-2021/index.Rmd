# A note on this document {.unnumbered}

You will find contained in this online document all the materials you need for this course. The book sets out for each week the readings that we will be discussing for each of the four weekly seminars. It also contains a set of take-home exercises. You can read more about the structure of the course in the next Introduction section. Note: this is a "live" document, meaning that I will continue to tweak some things. But fear not, the main course materials and assigned readings will not change.
